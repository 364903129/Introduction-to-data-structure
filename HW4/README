Main objective: Simulate 5 Bank Teller lines, similar to the single Bank
Teller line that we discussed in class, which is also described in Chapter 8 of
the P&C textbook. Customers come into the SlugFest Bank, and they wait
on one of the Teller lines. Each input line contains the name of the customer
(with no spaces in that name), the number of the Teller line that the customer
waits on (from 1 to 5), the arrival time for the customer, and the number of
minutes that the customer’s banking transaction takes. Arrival time for a
customer is just the number of minutes since the simulation started that the
customer arrived. For example, the input line:
4 Jefferson 25 8
means that customer Jefferson arrives 25 minutes after the simulation started,
waits on Teller 4’s line, and has a banking transaction that takes 8 minutes.
