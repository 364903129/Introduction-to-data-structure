// README Balanced.java Makefile StackReferenceBased.java Node.java

Main objective: Determine whether any expression with multiple kinds of
brackets, braces and parentheses is balanced using a reference-based stack.
You must implement the stack directly yourselves. Using a stack library, or
JCF stacks, or a list ADT will earn no credit.
Types of brackets: There are four “parenthesis/bracket” pairs:
• ( and )
• [ and ]
• { and }
• < and >
