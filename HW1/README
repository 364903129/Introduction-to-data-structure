Main objective: 
Solve the n queens problems. You have to place n queens on an n Ã—
n chessboard such that no two attack each other. Important: the chessboard should be
indexed starting from 1, in standard (x, y) coordinates. Thus, (4, 3) refers to the
square in the 4th column and 3rd row.

We have a slight twist in this assignment. We will take as input the position of
one queen, and have to generate a solution with a queen in this position.
