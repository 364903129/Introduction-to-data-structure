The purpose of this lab assignment is to have you program in the C programming language, including standard
input-output functions, command line arguments, File IO, and compilation with Makefiles. This file describes
the Lab4 Assignment. But to do Lab4, you should first read the file Some_Helpful_Background_on_C.pdf.
Students already familiar with C are probably familiar with most of that material; students who didn’t know C
but are taking CMPS 12M will recognize that we’re repeating some material in that file.
