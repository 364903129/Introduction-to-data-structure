The goal of this assignment is to learn how to implement ADTs in C, even though it is not an object-oriented
language. We discuss the typedef and struct commands, header files, information hiding, constructors and
destructors, and memory management in a separate file called Some_Additional_Background_on_C.pdf.
You will write a program in C that creates a simple Queue ADT. Please read the file
Some_Additional_Background_on_C.pdf first, before reading this file
